# Annatar — State

Living document. Updated after every step. Tracks where the project stands,
the decisions taken, and the tradeoffs behind them.

- **Plan:** [`plan.md`](./plan.md)
- **Overview:** [`project.md`](./project.md)

## Current state

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Phase | 0 — Skeleton |
| Step | 0.1 CLI, config, logging — **done** |
| Last updated | 2026-10-03 |
| Toolchain | rustc 1.97.0, edition 2024 |

### Done

- **0.1 CLI, config, logging.** `annatar` binary with `clap` subcommands
  `index`, `show`, `search`, `serve` (stubs), global `--path`, `-v` and
  `--config`. `annatar.toml` loaded into a typed `Config` (`repo`, `data_dir`,
  `ticket_regex`, `jira`, `ollama`), secrets from environment, validation on
  load, `tracing` logging with `RUST_LOG` override. 5 config tests, green.
  `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -D warnings` clean.
  Realigned to the refined plan on 2026-10-03: single `database` path became
  `data_dir` (the two-file `index.db` + `cache.db` layout), and `embedding_dim`
  was removed from config (5.1 reads it from the first embedding response).

### Next

- 0.2 Database files: `Store` opening `cache.db`, building `index.db` in a
  temp file and atomically renaming on finish.

## Step log

| Step | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.1 CLI, config, logging | done | `--help` works; 5 config tests green; realigned to refined plan (`data_dir`, no `embedding_dim`) |
| 0.2 Database files | next | two-file layout |

## Decisions and tradeoffs

| # | Decision | Alternatives | Rationale / consequence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `Config::parse` is pure (text in), `Config::load` reads the file and then the environment | One loader that reads env inline | Keeps config tests deterministic and free of global env state |
| 2 | Secrets (`ANNATAR_JIRA_TOKEN`, `ANNATAR_JIRA_EMAIL`) only from env; `deny_unknown_fields` rejects them in the file | Allow secrets in `annatar.toml` | Config file stays shareable/committable; a test asserts a `token` key is rejected |
| 3 | Added `--config <FILE>` (default `annatar.toml`), not in the plan | Fix the path to `annatar.toml` in the cwd | Lets tests and multiple checkouts point at their own config; cheap to remove |
| 4 | Validate `ticket_regex` compiles at load time | Validate lazily at first use | Fail fast with a clear message; an invalid regex is a config bug, not a per-file one |
| 5 | Binary + library split (`src/lib.rs` + `src/main.rs`) | Binary only | Enables unit tests now and integration tests (`tests/`) later without invoking the process |
| 6 | Stub subcommands still load config before printing "not implemented" | Stubs that parse nothing | Exercises the config path end to end and gives real errors for a missing/invalid config |
| 7 | Verbosity map `0=warn, 1=info, 2=debug, 3+=trace`; `RUST_LOG` wins | Always `info` | Sensible default silence, full detail on demand, env escape hatch |
| 8 | Jira auth modeled as optional `token` + `email`, not required at load | Require auth for every run | `index`/`show`/`search` can run before Jira is wired; only a Jira-calling command will require it |
| 9 | Defaults: ticket regex `\bGRLD-\d+\b`, Ollama URL `http://localhost:11434` | Require both explicitly | Matches the plan's stated default and local Ollama convention; fewer mandatory keys |
| 10 | `JiraConfig` has a hand-written redacting `Debug` (`token` shown as `***`) | Derive `Debug` | Prevents a secret leaking into logs the first time someone debugs the config |
| 11 | Config exposes `data_dir`, not a database file path (refined plan) | A single `database` path, or `index_db` + `cache_db` paths | Ground rules define two files with different lifecycles; 0.2's `Store` derives both names from one directory, so config stays one key |
| 12 | `embedding_dim` dropped from config (refined plan) | Keep it and validate | 5.1 takes the dimension from the first embedding response, so config would only be a second source of truth that can disagree |

## Open questions

| # | Question | Raised at | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Jira auth scheme: Cloud uses email + API token (basic auth), Server/DC often uses a personal access token (bearer). Assume Cloud for now? | 0.1 | open |
| 2 | Config discovery: search parent directories, or add `ANNATAR_CONFIG`? Currently only cwd/`--config`. | 0.1 | open, defer |
| 3 | Should `jira` / `ollama` sections become optional per command (e.g. `show` may not need Jira)? | 0.1 | open |
| 4 | `--path` is currently a `String`; make it a `PathBuf` once the walker lands (1.1)? | 0.1 | open |
